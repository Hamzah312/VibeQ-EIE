It was wrapped in foil, but something had gotten to it—mold blooming in green spots, damp and clinging. The smell hit me when I opened it, sour and thick, like something rotting in a drain. I threw it out without thinking, then scrubbed the compartment with wipes until my hands ached. Now I can't stop thinking about where it came from, who left it there, how long it's been sitting in the dark."}

The hallway light switch isn’t working either, just that faint click each time I flip it. I can't tell if someone’s moving around or if I'm imagining the footsteps. Either way, I don’t feel safe here tonight."}

We ended up sitting on the floor together, him licking syrup off my fingers. I put on that old record with the crackly jazz piano, and for once, nothing needed fixing. The whole house just hummed along quietly."}
